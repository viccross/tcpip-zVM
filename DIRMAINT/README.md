# DIRMAINT
Files for configuration of the IBM Directory Maintenance Facility (DirMaint) product.

## Content
There's a directory for each minidisk for which I have files.  Applying the file is as simple as copying the file to the named minidisk, using appropriate transfer attributes (usually RECFM F, LRECL 80).
