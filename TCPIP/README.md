# TCPIP
Files for configuration of the TCPIP SVMs (base TCPIP, as well as LDAP, UFT, etc).

## Content
There's a directory for each minidisk for which I have files.  Applying the file is as simple as copying the file to the named minidisk, using appropriate transfer attributes (usually RECFM F, LRECL 80).
